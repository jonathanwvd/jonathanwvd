# My work at Latos

## Predictive Maintenance in a Manufacturing Company
* Responsible for developing a Machine Learning solution for Predictive Maintenance in a manufacturing company that predicts machine breakdown aiming to anticipate maintenance. 
* The solution collects data from different software and runs algorithms to quantify the machine degradation. The algorithm and the back-end were building Python and Django. 
* Grafana Dashboards were used for the visualization of the results.

### Outcome of the project
With the solution, the manufacturing company was able to reduce maintenance costs by 28%, increase the machine's useful life by 220%, and reduce downtime. This represents millions of dollars in safes. This case earns a national award for the best application in Industry 4.0 in 2021. The solution was presented by the maintenance manager of the manufacturing company on the link provided below.

## Heron
• We realized that much of the time spent on a Data Science and Data Analysis solution in manufacturing was related to back-end development and deployment, at the same time, all the solutions have similar requirements. 
• Knowing this, developed a web-based platform to facilitate the development of Data Science solutions in manufacturing. 
• Heron integrates with different data sources, allows the easy development of Python modules for the most diverse applications, and saves the results back to a database (Influx DB), which is easy to query in many different visualization tools, such as Grafana, Power BI, Tableau, and others. 
• The platform was built with Python (Django) and runs on EC2 instances in AWS.

### Outcome of the project
Heron is running in two manufacturing companies, which are generating online indicators that are been used by engineers in decision-making. We are negotiating with two more potential customers. Python and Django were a choice that allowed the fast development of the first version of Heron even in a small team like ours.

## Other Projects
* [Latos Website](www.latos.ai) - The static website was build using Gulp, Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSV, and HTML5.
