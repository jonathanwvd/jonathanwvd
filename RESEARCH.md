## Description
* Used scientific programming with Python to solve different control loop problems in process industries.
* Published many works in high-impact Journals. Most of them are related to Artificial Intelligence and data-driven solutions.
* Spent 7 months in the Artificial Intelligence group at the University of Kaiserslaurnter to improve my AI knowledge.
* Interpreted research specifications and developed a work plan that satisfies requirements.
* Used books, journal articles, newspaper sources, questionnaires, surveys, polls, and interviews to gather data.
* Analyzed and interpreted patterns and trends.
* Recorded findings by taking written notes and using appropriate software.
* Maintained and protected electronic databases.
* Wrote proposals and delivered presentations when required.

## Outcome

* Petrobras, an Oil & Gas company in Brazil, is using the solutions developed. The solutions are helping to increase the performance of the refineries, allowing savings of millions of dollars.

* [SISO-VIEW](https://github.com/jonathanwvd/sisoviewer) - An open source Control-loop Performance Monitoring tool. The solutions was built using Python and Dash.
